<p>What is truth? “Truth,” says a standard logician, “signifies
nothing but the joining or separating of signs, as the things signified
by them do agree or disagree with one another;” that is, in making
propositions. These are divided into mental and verbal. Truth
then consists in ideal or verbal sentences, or, in other words, in a certain
arrangement of ideas and words. This view of the subject may
answer for a mere definition; but it is not satisfactory. We are disposed
to make truth consist in <i>things</i>, and not alone in their representatives.
It is the reality of things; using the term thing as it is,
the most universal of any in the language, including every object of
sense or conception, objects past, present, and future, objects terrestrial
and celestial, objects of all space and all duration, objects possible
and impossible; in a word, every-thing. There are propositions
concerning things; we have ideas of things, and things themselves
exist independently of both. The verbal statement, and the mental
apprehension, may accord with the reality of the thing, and be true,
or figuratively speaking, the truth. But can it be strictly said that
the truth consists in them, and them only?</p>

<p>But this train of remark avails little in resolving the momentously
practical question, What is truth? To give this a reply worthy of
itself, would lead us beyond our present design, and each reader
must be left to judge for himself.</p>

<p>“Truth is consistent with itself.” This is a common saying, and
regarded as axiomatic in its nature. It is not intended for the identical
proposition, Truth is truth; but that whatever is truth in one
subject, can in no way be rendered nugatory or false, by what is
truth in any other subject; and that one truth in the same subject is
not weakened or diminished by any other truth in the same subject.
Truth, as before intimated, may be considered in a three-fold aspect;
in itself; in regard to the verbal propositions embracing it; in respect
to our own conceptions of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>In itself, in its own nature, it may be consistent with itself. But
of the many truths with which our acquaintance is imperfect, we
cannot judge whether they agree, or disagree, among themselves.
In regard to some others, of which we are better assured, it is difficult
to say that there is no contradiction.</p>

<p>In propositions there is certainly great discrepancy; owing partly
to the barrenness of language, and to the ambiguity of terms; also
to the different impressions which different authors of the statement
may possess, and which the same man may have at different times.
The propositions may be too brief, or too ample; in many ways
they are made to disagree one with another, and as they are the
representatives of truth, for all practical purposes truth itself is often
found inconsistent with itself.</p>

<p>We find our own conceptions of truth exceedingly contradictory;
which is attributable to the limited nature of our faculties, and narrow
extent of our observations. It is only the <i>ends</i> of truths that we see.
Their remote extension, and multiplied relations, we cannot ascertain.
There <i>appears</i> to be much disagreement. In theology the
doctrines of decrees and free agency are both true, but who can reconcile
them? This apparent inconsistency of truth is the origin
of scepticism, and is the occasion of many unhappy dissensions
among men.</p>

<p>“Great is truth, and it will prevail.” The harmlessness of this
declaration has permitted it to pass unmolested. It certainly is a
pleasing prediction, and in the prospect which it unfolds, has inspired
many a languid heart with fresh vigor in the cause of truth.
From the implicit reliance which most men place in its verity, and
from the wish of all for its fulfillment, is manifested the confidence
which each reposes in his own integrity, and also a secret admiration
of truth in the minds of all. But the sentiment is perhaps more
flattering to the nobleness of our nature, than accordant with our
constant experience. That some truths will prevail, is certain.
But in respect to others&mdash;for instance, the thousand and one litigated
points in history, how shall the truth ever be ascertained. If the
facts were noted at the time of their occurrence, prejudice operated
to distort them. If not till years had elapsed, it was the effect of
remoteness to obliterate, or obscure them. Years and centuries are
bearing us still farther from the period of their transpiring, and how
is it possible, that, without a revelation from heaven, the truth shall
ever be disclosed?</p>

<p>In metaphysics are many points equally indeterminable. Here a
man’s own mind is the field of observation, in every part of which
the most rigid, extensive, and patient scrutiny, and the most careful
comparison have been made by the most profound thinkers, and with
the best lights; but up to this time there are many points unillustrated,
undecided. Will they ever be made more plain? Who does
not feel that there are doubtful points in himself that he will never
understand, at least this side of the grave?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>In the sciences, which suffer less from prejudice than most subjects
of investigation, the want of facts will prevent the discovery of
truth on many points; while, faster than old questions are settled,
new subjects of discussion are advanced.</p>

<p>With respect to the active duties of life, temperament will continue
to influence our views of truth, as it always has done.</p>

<p>Prejudice, which is the great barrier to the entrance of truth into
the mind, must, while man exists under his present mental and
moral constitution, retain the influence it now exerts.</p>

<p>There are many truths of which the highest order of human intellect
can only catch a fleeting glimpse, and the amount of knowledge
is graduated downwards, corresponding with the ability to
grasp it. Many points lie equally balanced between truth and
falsehood.</p>

<p>We do not then seem to be sufficiently warranted in the opinion
that truth, i. e. all truth, will prevail.</p>

<p>“Men are more willing to embrace error than truth.” No one
will admit this imputation in his own case; but by an easy generalization,
each one applies it to all other men.</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether a love of truth or of error, for <i>their
own sake</i>, is a primary principle of our moral nature. A love of
one’s own happiness, or interest, or reputation, in a word, of one’s
self, is primary. Truth and error are regarded with complaisance
or aversion, accordingly as they oppose or favor the interests of men.
If there were but one being in the universe, it would be of little moment
whether he passed his existence in truth or falsehood. In society,
he, whose basis is falsehood, is derided by his fellows, and
his interests are endangered. As truth, on the whole, is most conducive
to the interests of men, it is most generally sought after.
Few are willing to oppose a fashionable error. There are portions
of every man’s whole life, which he passes in error, without being
in the least concerned. Many minds are so preoccupied, that they
<i>cannot</i> examine the evidence requisite for the admission of a new
truth. More are so prejudiced that they will not. With many men
a fear of results is stronger than love of truth, and they are induced
by a prospect of consequences, to abandon the pursuit. An entire
devotion to truth itself, to truth for its own sake, is a rare sight, and
one of high moral sublimity.</p>

any similar production as much praise as he chooses, and subduct the same from me. An author
<i>ought</i> to know if he is guilty of plagiarism; and though I may err, it is my opinion, that among
the many who have written upon this subject, though I may not boast of as much beauty, I may
at least have been as far from stealing as the best of the rhyming tribe. These are indeed days
of barter&mdash;still I would live on my own capital.</p>

<h2 id="SIR_THOMAS">SIR THOMAS MORE’S WORKS.</h2>

<p class="h2sub"><i>Lib. Old Eng. Prose Writers&mdash;Vol. 9.&mdash;Boston, 1834.</i></p>

<p>Self-sufficiency, under one form or another, is the predominant
vice of the present age. A disposition to neglect the gathered
wisdom of former times, and to deny all reverence to customs and
institutions from which our fathers deemed it inseparable, and to go
forward rejoicing in <i>our own</i> strength, is becoming more and more
apparent. And whether we regard this sentiment as the fool-hardiness
resulting from ignorance, and as ‘the pride which goeth before
a fall,’ or, which we are more inclined to do, as the exultation of
conscious might, and the prelude of more glorious achievements&mdash;still
it is a vice, and requires the most vigorous exertions to check its
further progress. These remarks are most obviously applicable to
political matters, but they are not without meaning in reference to
<i>literature</i>. Even in this department of knowledge, there has become
manifest a proneness to circumscribe curiosity and inquiry
within the narrow circle of cotemporary writers, to extol our popular
authors, as the only ones deserving our attention, and as incontestably
superior to all who have gone before them. It is difficult
to determine whether this feeling is more unjust to those great lights
of learning, who laid the <i>foundations</i> of our literature, by defrauding
them of their merited homage, or more unfortunate for ourselves, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
depriving us of their illumination. Nor is it less <i>absurd</i>, than it is
unjust and unfortunate. For if we are indeed at the culminating
point, whence beams of light and beauty shall fall on succeeding
ages, the closest investigation can but confirm the truth; but if we
are <i>not</i>, by timely consideration we may be saved from the error of
those ancient astronomers, who assumed this little earth to be the
center of the universe, and <i>therefore</i>, at each supposed advance,
plunged deeper in error and perplexity. And those, who, in utter
ignorance of our older writers, are ever asserting the preeminence of
Byron and Bulwer and Irving, should be careful, lest, with those
who have traveled further in the world of letters, they may incur
the charge of weakness, no less ridiculous than that of the vain Chinese,
who imagine <i>their</i> land, the only radiant point in a world of
darkness.</p>

<p>Nor would the results of a candid and thorough examination of
the early English writers, be really prejudicial to the reputation of
cotemporary works; for though we might return from our researches
with a less extravagant complacency in the productions of living
authors, it would be more strongly established. We should meet
with opposite merits and opposite faults. If our current literature
is more frivolous, theirs is more prolix; if their thoughts are more
sound, and their style more simple, our reasoning is more pointed,
and our expression more sparkling&mdash;if we are more disgusted here
with spurious originality, we are oftener wearied there with staid
monotony.</p>

<p>We have been led into these reflections, by the perusal of several
volumes of ‘the Library of Old English Prose Writers.’ Among
the many series, which have of late appeared in England and this
country, under the specious name of ‘Libraries,’ there is none so
truly deserving as this, of the approbation and support of the educated
and intellectual portion of the community&mdash;and to them, from
its peculiar character, it must be almost entirely confined. Other
publications, appealing to the interests or the love of novelty and
excitement of the ‘reading public,’ meet with a ready support. But
this series, whose design and tendency is to correct this corrupt taste,
and chasten this morbid partiality to the matter-of-fact, or the
romantic, cannot expect a promiscuous patronage. It is emphatically
the <i>literature of literary men</i>, and all such, if they have any
sympathy with ‘sober thought, in simple language dressed,’ nay, to
appeal to selfish motives only, if they have any regard for the improvement
of their taste, the strengthening of their own minds, or
the purifying of their own style, will not fail to search out and drink
deeply of these ‘healthful wells of English undefiled.’ We would
gladly ramble through the several works of which the ‘Library’ is
composed, but time does not permit, and we hasten to the consideration
of the last of their number, with the simple remark that the plan
of the undertaking is so praiseworthy, and the manner of its execution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
thus far has evinced so correct a judgment, and refined a taste,
that we cannot but regret that any circumstances should for a moment
delay its progress.</p>

<p>The fame of Sir Thomas More’s Utopia must be familiar to every
ear. Its authority as a classic is so high, quotations from it are so
numerous, and allusions to it among literary, political and metaphysical
writers, are so frequent and eulogistic, that no one who has
passed beyond the first lispings of polite learning, can be presumed
ignorant of its general character. But a much smaller number, probably,
are acquainted with it from actual examination and study.
Before the appearance of this edition it had long been out of print in
this country, or excluded from general circulation by being buried
in an expensive and cumbrous volume, among the ponderous controversial
writings of its author; and in rescuing it from its unfortunate
companionship, the editor has conferred no slight gratification
upon the lovers of serious thought and quaint style. A clear view
of the design and plan of the work, cannot better be obtained, than
by a brief analysis of its contents.</p>

<p>The author, for the convenience of setting forth his ideal of a
perfect commonwealth, in a plainer and bolder manner than the
jealousy of the government and the church would allow, feigns the
existence of an island, Utopia, in a remote quarter of the globe, unknown
to the people of Europe, and recently discovered by the celebrated
navigator, Vespucci. Raphael Hylleloday, a philosopher,
who accompanied Vespucci in his voyages, through curiosity, to examine
the condition of the new-found nations, having become intimately
versed in the history and manners of the Utopians, conveys a
lengthened and minute account of the same to his friend More, at
that time employed in the ‘king’s embassat’ in Flanders.</p>

<p>Upon this hypothesis, the philosophical romance is founded; and
under the form of historical narrative, the author unfolds his views of
the manners, customs, pursuits, government and religion, which
would obtain among a perfectly happy people. He condemns with
severity, and ridicules with sharpness, the policy, both temporal and
spiritual, which was pursued by the governments of Europe, and the
whole system of social relations, which prevailed among the people.
He exposes with equal fearlessness, the folly and wickedness of royal
tyranny, prelatical intolerance, and private avarice. He pictures in
earnest simplicity, the advantages of equality of rank, temperance in
living, freedom of opinion, and general education; and much more
than anticipates in theory, all the advances which have actually
been made, in more than three centuries. In order to feel the full
admiration, which the perusal of the ‘Utopia’ should legitimately
excite, the reader must constantly bear in mind, the period at which
the author wrote. Many positions, which to us appear obvious and
common place,&mdash;because we have been familiar with them, as undoubted
truisms, from our childhood&mdash;evinced in our author surpassing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
vigor of thought, and boldness of purpose, joined with a sagacity
almost prophetic. The extent to which he pushed his liberality in
religion, in an age distinguished for its bloody bigotry, may be learned
from the following extract. (p. 159.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For this is one of their most ancient laws, that no man ought to be punished
for his religion. At the first constitution of their government, Utopas having understood,
that before his coming among them, the old inhabitants had been engaged
in great quarrels concerning religion, by which they were so divided among
themselves, that he found it an easy thing to conquer them, since instead of uniting
their forces against him, every different party in religion fought by themselves;
after he had subdued them, he made a law that every man might be of what religion
he pleased, and might endeavor to draw others to it by the force of argument,
and by amicable and modest ways, but without bitterness against those of other
opinions; but that he ought to use no other force but that of persuasion, and was
neither to mix with it reproaches nor violence; and such as did otherwise were to
be condemned to banishment or slavery.”</p>
</div>

<p>To affirm that all the maxims and institutions in this fictitious system
of politics are unexceptionable, and would be desirable if <i>realized</i>,
would be foolish eulogium&mdash;indeed, in some very important
features, (we would refer particularly to the chapters on ‘the Manner
of Living,’ on ‘Slavery,’ and on ‘Marriages,’) the progress of political
science and moral philosophy, has shown that there is much
that is erroneous and defective. The grand error is, and it is a very
common one among theorists, in allowing to corrupt human nature a
higher degree of moral perfection, than it has ever yet vindicated its
claims to, and, resting upon this unsubstantial basis, must fall to the
ground. The candid reader, however, cannot fail to admire the
acuteness and honesty of the reasoning, and to wonder at the nobleness
of the sentiments upon the great subjects of civil and religious
freedom, when he reflects that the author was a courtier under the
despotic Henry VIII, and was a tenacious Romanist, amid the fierce
struggles of the Reformation. He will also be highly pleased with
the simplicity of language in which the profoundest truths are conveyed,
and will often be provoked to a smile, as he detects, under
the modest guise of our author’s graceful style, many a thought, which
with pompous epithet, and startling antithesis, has been brought
forth as the offspring of the ‘wonderful advance of mind in the
XIXth century.’ And if he should be ready to point at some passages
as absurd, and at others as childishly simple, let him remember,
that according to competent critics, the prince of ancient philosophers,
Plato, is not free from similar crudities. The most valuable
portions of the work, are those which are employed in the discussion
of permanent moral and political principles, though the most curious
and amusing, are the descriptions of the island, and of the domestic
and civil habits of its citizens. There are, here and there, some
positions of even ludicrous extravagance, which the author, it would
seem, intended to serve him as a refuge from the charge of heresy,
by giving his book the aspect of an idle and humorous fiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>The latter half of the volume is occupied with the ‘History of
King Richard III’&mdash;and though it does not possess the intrinsic value
of the Utopia, it acquires even a higher interest from the circumstance
of its being the <i>earliest specimen</i> of English prose, intelligible
to readers of the present day.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is also deserving of great attention,
as the original chronicle of that troublous and tragical reign,
written while several of the actors in its scenes are yet living. It is
in this light, as the ‘Father of English Prose,’ that the character of
Sir Thomas More appears most interesting. He was the first to
break loose from the prevailing custom, which confined all learning
and philosophy and history, to the constrained medium of a dead
language, and commenced those efforts in the living English, which
have resulted in giving us a vernacular prose literature, unequalled
by that of any other language in the world. He was fortunate too
in living just at that period, when the language had acquired sufficient
elegance and copiousness, to render it in a great measure permanent.
The tasteful reader will be tempted to wish that our native
Saxon had been suffered to retain its pristine vigor, unencumbered
with such ponderous accumulations, as it has since received,
though it had remained less magnificent in its periods, and less fertile
in synonymes.</p>

<p>The principal points worthy of notice in this venerable composition,
are, the honest straight-forward course of the narrative, the discrimination
in the portraiture of character, and in tracing outward
actions to their secret causes, and the nature and individuality shown
in the speeches, which, in imitation of the manner of Livy and Sallust,
he puts in the mouths of his personages. We were much
struck with the <i>perfect</i> coincidence with this authentic chronicle,
maintained in Shakspeare’s drama of Richard III. It is exceedingly
thorough and minute, and affords gratifying evidence that the
efforts of the imagination may with success be made subservient to
impressing and illustrating historical truth. As an instance of this
resemblance, as well as for the purpose of exhibiting our author’s
<i>original</i> style, we quote as follows. (p. 302-304.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And thus, as I have learned of them that much knew and little cause had to lie,
were these two noble princes, these innocent, tender children, born of most royal
blood, brought up in great wealth, likely long to live to reign and rule in the realm,
by traitorous tyranny taken, deprived of their estate, shortly shut up in prison, and
privily slain and murthered, their bodies cast, God wot where, by the cruel ambition
of their unnatural uncle and his dispiteous tormentors. Which things on every
part well pondered, God never gave this world a more notable example, neither
in what unsurety standeth this worldly weal, or what mischief worketh the
proud enterprise of a high heart, or finally what wretched end ensueth such dispiteous
cruelty. For first, to begin with the ministers, Miles Forrest at Saint Martin’s
piecemeal rotted away. Dighton indeed yet walketh on alive, in good possibility
to be hanged ere he die. But Sir James Tyrrel died at Tower hill, beheaded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
for treason. King Richard himself, as ye shall hereafter hear, slain in the field,
hacked and hewed of his enemies’ hands, harried on horseback dead, his hair in despite
torn and togged like a cur dog. And the mischief that he took, within less
than three years of the mischief that he did. And yet all the mean time, spent in
much pain and trouble outward, much fear, anguish and sorrow within. For I
have heard by credible report of such as were secret with his chamberers, that after
this abominable deed done, he never had quiet in his mind, he never thought
himself sure. Where he went abroad, his eyen whirled about, his body privily
fenced, his hand ever on his dagger, his countenance and manner like one always
ready to strike again; he took ill rest a nights, lay long waking and musing, sore
wearied with care and watch, rather slumbered than slept, troubled with fearful
dreams, suddenly sometime start up, leap out of his bed and run about the chamber;
so was his restless heart continually tossed and tumbled with the tedious impression
and stormy remembrance of his abominable deed.”</p>
</div>

<p>The character of Sir Thomas More is one of the noblest that the
whole circle of history can present, and his whole career was as glorious,
in the highest sense of that term, as the loftiest aspirations
could desire. His fame rests not on the adventitious distinctions of
rank or political authority, or on the short lived eminence, conferred
by popular idolatry; for, though he was placed high in office, though
he was courted by his sovereign, beloved by his equals, and worshiped
by his inferiors&mdash;the native power of his intellect, and loftiness
of his spirit, shed the proudest luster upon his name. We have
already had occasion to notice some points of his greatness, in the
review of his works. In his Utopia we found him a subtle reasoner,
and bold asserter of the rights of man; and in his history, we met
with an honest annalist, and skillful pioneer in the untraced paths of
English literature. In many other respects he was no less gifted by nature,
and favored by fortune. He was the first <i>lay</i> chancellor of
England, that high station, before his accession, having been entirely
monopolized by churchmen. He is the <i>first</i> person in English history
distinguished for senatorial eloquence, and the earliest champion
of parliamentary liberty. He was the first, as speaker of the House
of Commons, to teach that body the use of that power, which, as
keeper of the purse of the nation, it possessed, and which, in later
times, it has exerted with so overwhelming an influence on the destinies
of the nation. In a word, he was the <i>first</i> of British ministers,
who deserved, in all its breadth, the title of a <i>statesman</i>. His
personal character was no less lovely, than his public career was
commanding. The sweetness of his disposition, the mirthfulness of
his temper, his reluctance to engage in the stormy contentions of
political ambition, the depth of his learning, and the order of his
piety, are alike conspicuous&mdash;and the manner of his death has associated
his fame with that of the martyrs to tyranny ‘for conscience
sake.’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Reader</span>;</p>

<p>Lest, from the fact that we have hitherto drawn our mottos
from “The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy,” the suspicion
may be festering in your brain that poor Nescio Quod has confined
his reading among the older English writers to this single work, it
may not be amiss to adduce such evidence, as shall set at rest so
unjust and injurious a surmise.</p>

<p>For instance&mdash;had he wished to be sarcastical upon himself, and
thus, by a common artifice, predispose his critics to clemency, he
might, in reference to the multitudinous array of <i>shadowy</i> jests&mdash;flitting
around the brightness of the reader’s fancy, like moths
around a candle, to their own destruction&mdash;have cited this keen retort
of Fuller&mdash;“It is good to make a jest, but not to make a trade
of jesting.”</p>

<p>Or, in allusion to the somewhat pedantic display of information,
varied, but worthless, he might have adopted from the same author
a complaint at the frivolous attainments of the idle and riotous student&mdash;“Yet,
<i>perchance</i>, he may get some <i>alms</i> of learning, here a
snap, there a piece of knowledge, but nothing to purpose.”</p>

<p>Or, in a mood of preeminent self-complacency, he might have imagined
that the reader’s feelings towards him, maugre his faults and
his prolixity, might be fitly expressed in the language of the Spectator
(after Martial.)</p>

<p>Or, in defense of his desultory style&mdash;half-way between the frisking
pirouettes of Harlequin, and the staid pace of the moraliser, he
might have borrowed a circumlocutory sentence from the bungling
Locke&mdash;“I would have him try whether he can keep one unvaried,
single idea in his mind without any other, for any considerable
length of time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>Or, having in his mind the stolidity of those, who condescended
gravely to condemn so trifling a <i>jeu d’esprit</i>, he might have taken to
his aid a sarcasm from Smollett&mdash;“Some formidable critics declared
that the work was void of humor, character, and sentiment.”</p>

<p>Or, revolving in his thoughts the mystery attending the appearance
of the first number, and the pining curiosity excited to unveil
its paternity, with flattered pride, he might have quoted a splendid
sentence from Count Fathom&mdash;“Over and above this important secret,
under which he was begotten, other particularities attended his
birth, and seemed to mark him out as uncommon among the sons of
men.”&mdash;These “<i>ancient</i> instances” will suffice, my reader, if you
are in a yielding mood, to convince you that, if Tristram is called
upon somewhat often, it is less a matter of necessity, than of choice.
I am doubting whether it would not be a most Machiavelian stroke
of diplomatic wisdom, to persuade you that I perceive all my failings.
Surely your admiration at my frankness would outweigh your
anger at the repetition of my sins. I am sometimes affected, and,
now and then, I perpetrate a <i>verbicide</i>. I like to make new words&mdash;I
feel for them the affection of a father. I am slightly tinctured

<p>Which lines the <i>Il</i>-literati are to know mean, “A self-complacent
writer often inadvertently draws his heroes like himself.” Thus I,
forgetting the precise terms of the <i>conversators</i>, (there <i>ought</i> to be
such a word,) make them parley in a brogue very like my own. I
am, moreover, somewhat vain, though less so than Ovid, or Horace,
(Vide Metam. lib. 15. in fine. and Hor. 2.20 3.30.) or than that
Etrurian Spurinna, whom Valerius Maximus cites as an instance of
modesty, though he was rather an example of uncommon self-inflation;
since he thought himself so <i>killing</i>, that he disfigured his
face, lest he should unwittingly seduce his fair country-women!</p>

<p>I would that I could affirm with Falstaff in the play, “I am not
only witty in myself, but I am likewise the cause that wit is in other
men.” But the protasis will, I fear, be doubted by the judicious, and
my own observation tells me that the apodosis is false. I am naturally
neither contemptuous nor malicious, but when I look around
me, and behold so many with but two ideas, “one for superfluity
and one for use,” and reflect that I may myself rank among that
soulless number, I become almost a misanthrope, and quite a scorner.
“Les diseurs des bons mots,” says Pascal, “sont mauvais
caractères.” “The perpetrators of witticisms are bad men.” Yet
the same author observes, that silence is the severest punishment,
and, since novelty is all that can gain one notoriety at the present
day, I know not why I should not attempt to be new, at least, if not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
witty. I sometimes think I would rather give utterance to a brilliant
error than a stupid truth, and, like Tully, espouse falsehood
with a Plato, rather than be right with the rabble. “Had the nose
of Cleopatra been shorter,” remarks an eminent writer, “the face of
the world had been altered.” (<i>Her</i> face would have been, at any
rate.) Had I, too, been born at an earlier era, before the fingers of
a million had compressed every square inch of this vast globe’s surface,
till it is as dry and hopeless as the peel of an eviscerated orange,
I, too, might have been at once original and wise. But all
truths have of late become <i>truisms</i>, and to reiterate them would be
like praising Shakspeare. Sufficient be it for me, (you will find
the thought somewhere in Irving,) if, like a skillful physician, who
gives you a pill enveloped in some palate-tickling sauce, I now and
then, under the guise of folly, pop down your throat a sound moral,
or a wholesome truth. My writings, if less grave in appearance,
will be more healthful in effect than Bellamy’s learned computation
of the earth’s inhabitants during the millennium, (whom he makes
so numerous that they would be compelled to lie in <i>strata</i>,) or the
labored inquiry of the ingenious Spaniard, whether it be more certain
that a <i>cause</i> will produce an <i>effect</i>, or that an <i>effect</i> must spring
from a <i>cause</i>. Pardon these patch-work prolegomena&mdash;remembering
that it is my fashion to place my thoughts in <i>Mosaic</i>&mdash;and pass
on to my compeers of the club.</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Well, Pulito, time flies, or,” (looking learnedly,) “<i>tempus
fugit</i>, as the Latins would say. If Quod and you are coming to
the point, I’ll e’en light my cigar, and listen with elongated and <i>patent</i>
ears.” (Here, after a series of wicked bantering, Apple was
forced to explain that <i>patent</i> meant <i>open</i>&mdash;he then continued pettishly,)
“I really thought you could see through a joke sooner&mdash;but if
you are not about to discuss, I’ll read to Tristo a few chapters of
my Psychological Autobiography, in which I have shown by induction
that <i>punning</i> may become a second nature, and that in numerous
consecutive instances&mdash;”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Enough, good Apple; I perceive the plan of your
work, and doubt not that it is profoundly amusing, and amusingly
profound. But why wish to read it to me, rather than to Nescio,
or Pulito?”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Because you are melancholy, and something light and
trifling might&mdash;”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “No, Apple, no! When I am sad, which is but too often,
I find no relief from the ludicrous, or the gay. I should sooner
look for an antidote to melancholy in the deep thought and earnest
style of Coleridge, than in the levities of Swift, or the whimsicalities
of Sterne. And an evening walk in the solemn starlight would
quicker soothe me than a merry ramble among the green hills in the
brightness of the morning. When the soul wanders through its airy
chambers in solitary sadness, let it not flee for refuge to the comic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
page, to laughter, or the song. Let it dwell upon scenes and objects,
more wretched than itself, till the sigh of sorrow burst into the
tear of pity. The descriptions of Crabbe, so gloomy, so powerful,
and so true, bear me away from sadness to solemnity, and the deep
conceptions of Foster lift me from solemnity to a high and tender
elevation.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Fool as I am, these bright spring mornings always
make even me serious.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Fools as we <i>all</i> are, there are times when the cup of
pleasure is as nauseous to the soul, as is wine to the sated palate of
the morning reveler. Why is it, Apple, why is it that the first gay
breath of spring is so saddening in its influence? Nature seems
then to burst from her winter’s sleep, like a resurrection from the
grave. The jocund earth puts on her brightest robes, as if soon to
celebrate her nuptials with heaven. The pulse of existence beats
high with new-born vigor, and the warm, bright blood runs riot
through the renovated veins. Alike in the open fields, and the
crowded city, throughout the glorious works of God, and the petty
creations of man, there is a newness of life, which, it would seem,
<i>must</i> fill every heart with bounding ecstacy. And so it may be, for
aught I know, with the busy and the riotous. But with the idle and
the thoughtful, the approach of spring produces, I am persuaded, far
different effects.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Physicians would tell us that the balmy breeze bears on
its wings a subtle, penetrating fluid, which dampens the spirits and
enfeebles the energies.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “No. While I allow that these early gales of spring,
which breathe life and vigor into all the rest of animated nature, unbrace
<i>our</i> nerves, and through those media of sensation, lower the
tone, and lessen the elasticity of the feelings, yet, for the main cause
would I look deeper&mdash;even in the mind. There are certain periods,
as we all know, when we are <i>forced to reflect</i>. Such periods
are, every serious change in the world without&mdash;the recurrence of a
birth-day, or the revisiting of home; and sometimes the sight of a
long-neglected volume, through whose pages I have strayed in pleasant
intercourse with an absent, or a buried friend, has brought paleness
to my lip, and sadness to my heart. And such an occasion,
preeminently, are the early days of spring; for spring (as the Germans
say) is the cradle-time of the year.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “The calendar, though, says otherwise. But go on.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “Then are we summoned to look forward to <i>another</i>
year, with hopes less wild and free than they were at the commencement
of the last; and we look backward, also, with a longer
and a sadder retrospect: and you know, Apple, that the memory of
a student is but a shadowy maze, where the forms, which, in <i>prospect</i>,
were gilded with glory, and girded with magnificence, to his
<i>backward</i> gaze, seem airy nothings, or shapes, palpable, indeed, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
unsightly&mdash;fiends, mocking at the vanity of his hopes, and the folly
of his grief. And thus the bland breath of the reviving year becomes,
through the mysterious principle of association, an instrument
of keenest anguish to the sensitive mind. This annual birth
of nature is a mile-stone, that notches our progress from the cradle
to the grave: the figures are surrounded by bloom and greenness,
but they are graven by the finger of Death.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “I think such brilliant days make us feel <i>too</i> well.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “They do. They kindle sensations too delightful for
continuance&mdash;our systems are too coarse, too frail&mdash;it seems as if an
electric finger were laid invisibly upon each shrinking nerve&mdash;a balm
circumfuses and permeates the heart, strange, ecstatic, overpowering.
The change, too, is often so abrupt as to cause an unpleasant
revulsion&mdash;the process (so far as regards the action of the mind) is
not unlike that by which we pass from the stern winter of our existence
here, to the bright and unending summer of the future life.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Well, Tristo, though I could not succeed in making
you merry, you have well nigh rendered me as sad as yourself.
And Quod and Pulito have stopped their wrangling to listen to your
melancholy.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Yes, Tristo, you are unwontedly depressed to-night,
and Dumpling has scarcely made a <i>pun</i> since we came together.
However, the coffee is ready, that will revive you both.”</p>

<p>The first cup sufficed to set Apple on his <i>legs</i>, (speaking intellectually,)
which he evinced by commencing a <i>running</i> fire of puns
and jests, too rapid for transcription; while Tristo, more slowly, but
not less surely, owned the mild, exhilarating influence. In the
mean time conversation lagged, and finally ceased, while they gave
themselves up to the more <i>sensible</i> pleasures of the palate. After a
while, Pulito, who appeared to have been collecting all his energies
for the onset, seized a moment, when Apple was poring over his
Autobiography, Tristo with a pleased smile was dipping into Little’s
poems, and Quod, as <i>magister morum</i> for the evening, was resettling
the coffee pot on its uneasy bed, and broke forth in a most
oratorical tone with the following introduction to the debate.</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “On whatever principle you may compare the writings
of the older novelists with the works of Bulwer and his school,
whether as to their effect, in instructing the mind, or improving the
heart, quickening the moral sense, or conveying useful information,
or even for mere interest, or whiling away the time in rational
amusement, (which last is but the lowest commendation of a good
novel): in any of these points of comparison, I maintain that the
older writers have a decided and manifest superiority. I might appeal,
for the support of this position, to the concurrent testimony of
literary men, to the fact that they have outlived contemporary criticism,
and are still classics in this fastidious age, and furthermore”&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p><i>Apple</i>, (looking up from his manuscript.) “What book is that
you’re reading out of, Pulito?”</p>

<p>“The book of my own intellect, as yet unpublished, Mr. Impertinence,”
said Pulito, somewhat disconcerted.</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “Indeed! As I was looking down, I thought from the
rapid and mellifluous flow of words, the elegance and profoundness
of the thought, that you were reading loud from some one of the
British Essayists. No insinuations, however,” and he chuckled at
the effect, while the others smiled at the harmlessness of his sarcasm.</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Don’t suppose, Pulito, that because I prefer the modern
to the ancient school among the English novelists, I therefore
deny all merit to the latter. It would be strange, indeed, if men,
who were admitted <i>unâ voce</i> to be the wits and geniuses of their
age, should not have displayed many, and great, and varied excellencies.
But won’t you allow that the incongruous mass, The
Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, has gained its greenest laurels
from its outrageous oddity? Its eccentricity is so astounding, so
far beyond anomaly itself, that criticism pauses aghast, as at ‘the
quills of the fretful porcupine,’ unknowing where to strike. You
might as soon trace ‘the path of a serpent on a rock,’ or reduce to
rule the movements of the wild ass of the desert. It is a mere
chaos&mdash;a “rudis indigestaque moles.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “But, my dear fellow, such the author intended to
have it.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Well, and what then? Suppose he had made it dull,
(as in fact much of it <i>is</i>, at least, to me,) would it be the more pleasing,
that the author had simply fulfilled his intentions? I like a
good conceit in my heart, and the more I like it, the more do I hate
to see it spoiled.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Do you assert that Sterne has spoiled his plan? If
you do, the world is against you.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “I beg your pardon. Those few are against me, who
copy their sentiments from one another, and who, I’ll be sworn,
never had the patience to read through what they so extravagantly
admire. There are many good judges, who have the taste to perceive
the unrivalled beauties of Sterne in particular passages, his
fine strokes of humor, his felicitous touches of character, and, therefore,
indiscriminately extol the whole.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Well, and I think they are about right.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “So they are, except in Tristram Shandy. But <i>there</i>
I maintain, that while uncle Toby, and Yorick, and in fact all the
actors, are among the most perfect pictures in the English language,
the scenes are yet, many of them, <i>unbearably</i> wearisome. I would
rather undertake to thread the labyrinth of Minos.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Now, in my view, this same rambling style constitutes
his great charm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Not at all. This attraction consists in the exquisite
fidelity of his characters, and the wit that gleams along his zigzag
path. His roving, if properly restrained, would be pleasing. But,
in the very nature of things, we cannot heartily like an author whom
we cannot keep in sight. He seems to have thought that <i>any</i> thing
would <i>take</i>, provided only it were irrelevant. If, indeed, these <i>disjecta
membra</i> were all brilliant or weighty, it would repay the labor
of putting them together. But when you have done this, and find
much of it absolute nonsense, you must feel spent, disappointed, and
angry.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Say what you will, and there is some truth in your words,
Sterne will always remain inimitable.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “I deny it not, and I hope he may. One such specimen,
however beautiful, of utter lawlessness, is quite enough, and
the fame of Sterne has already drawn many a weak-winged aspirant
from sober truth into erratic nonsense. That style, which, in <i>him</i>,
if affected, was, at least, original, in an <i>imitator</i> would be stale and
intolerable. By the way, have you ever read his Sermons and
Letters?”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Yes, and they are beautiful, are they not?”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Surpassingly. But what say you to the older novelists,
Fielding, Richardson and Smollett?”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Why, I say that their language is as much stronger and
purer, as their thoughts are better, and their characters more natural,
than those of Bulwer, and his tawdry tribe.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Well, I must admire your modesty, to speak thus of a
man, whom the spontaneous and infallible voice of a million has applauded,
till praise itself grows weary.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “The infallible voice of the million! Phoebus! their
words <i>are</i> oracular! It has not been a fact, then, has it, since the
stars first sang together, that whatever the <i>lions</i> of the day have done,
or written, these infallible judges have followed with their praise?
They did not shout ‘<i>te deum</i>’ to Cowley, when that worshipper
of the ‘dim obscure’ was the star of a voluptuous court, as vicious in
taste as it was depraved in morals? Each spectacled ‘mother in
Israel’ was not enraptured by Hervey’s magniloquent meditations
among the tombs? The horrors of Walpole, and the mysteries of
Radcliffe, the sorrows of Porter, with the bravery of her superhuman
Wallace, and the streaming eyes of her immaculate Amanda,
have not <i>all</i> been worshipped in their day as lords of the ascendant&mdash;have
not <i>all</i> risen, and shone, and set, in the April sky of popular
applause? Why, Quod, I am astonished that you should for a
moment adduce the opinion of the rabble as authority.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Out, aristocrat! where else <i>would</i> you look for natural
and unbiassed feeling? I tell you, that when the voice of a people
bursts forth in simultaneous applause, a work <i>must</i> be good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “And I tell you, that if at this moment our meretricious
press should bring forth the Letters of Junius, and the scribblings of
Jack Downing, the people, if left to themselves, would choose the
latter to reign over them, because the latter is most like themselves.
Besides, upon one of these fashionable novels you do not get the free
popular voice. Some giant critic, from prejudice, or false taste,
sends forth his <i>imprimatur</i>, and the groundlings catch and repeat the
cry,&mdash;as a mountain shakes the thunder from its cliffs, and the little
bills reverberate its voice.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “But the people have no interest to sway their opinion.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “Neither have they any judgment to guide it.”</p>

<p><i>Apple.</i> “To what, then, shall we resort? For criticism has always
shifted with the shifting taste of the age, and it may be shown
that the learned, and the polished, have fluctuated in their sentiments
as much as the ignorant and the coarse. Did not the voices
of the educated prefer Cowley and Dryden to Milton, until Addison
took Milton on his wing, and bore him far into the heaven of fame?
The critics of every age have followed the prevailing style of the
writers of their time; and, indeed, they have constituted a large portion
of those writers. Every thirty years has a style peculiar to itself&mdash;soft
or strong, plain or mystical, brief or diffuse, moralizing or
descriptive, simple or turgid; and the critics have set up no barrier,
and constituted no law.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “What you have said, <i>was</i> true, but <i>is</i> not. There are
now so many perfect specimens from every literary mine, that dross
or counterfeit is instantly detected. Criticism has become stable,
or, if ever influenced by prejudice, or local feeling, you have only to
take the average&mdash;cast them together into the alembic, and truth will
come forth. And indeed the <i>general</i> and <i>long-continued</i> opinion of
the multitude on a literary work, is always correct, partly because
nature speaks within them, and partly because they have been told
what to think by their superiors.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Don’t suppose I prefer the flimsy modern copyists, to
the eloquent Old English prose writers&mdash;the thinkers of the seventeenth
century. But what says your Criticism to the novelists of
the present age, as compared with those of eighty years since?”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “I speak not of Scott; for I admit, as must all, that to
the rest of story tellers, he is the sun in heaven. I likewise except
Edgeworth, and Marryatt, and, perhaps, James and Cooper. But
the Bulwerian is the prevailing style; and of him enlightened criticism
says, that, with much brilliancy, and some philosophy, there is
a great deal that is vicious in style, and false in sentiment, shallow in
reasoning, and depraving in tendency. It says that his aphorisms
are merely antitheses, striking, but untrue. His characters are too
strong contrasts to be natural; they are foils to one another.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “And where will you find a more glaring instance of this,
than in Scott’s Quentin Durward, where he introduces tragedy and
comedy&mdash;the executioners to Lewis, that subtle king?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “I allow it, and always considered the picture overcharged:
it is broad farce, and not real life.”</p>

<p><i>Nescio.</i> “Well, I will tell you what <i>I</i> think of Smollett. When
he is himself, he is coarse; and when he rises to the tender, he speaks
in language, which true lover and true poet never employed. His
sentimentality is to me disgusting, and his sketches, though laughable,
are many of them caricatures. He had a strong sense of the
ludicrous, but no taste for the refined. His sea-characters are admirable;
but when, in the History of England, were oaths and exclamations,
which I repeat not, so common in the mouths of <i>refined
ladies</i> even, as he would represent? When I close a volume of
Smollett, I rise with a sense of weariness&mdash;there is a something,
which I sought, and found not&mdash;his characters appear before me in
bold prominence, and they are consistent with themselves, but I
doubt me whether all of them are consistent with human nature.”</p>

<p><i>Pulito.</i> “There is something in what you say. Smollett fails in
some points: but his mind was powerful, and his language is strong,
and idiomatically pure. But in regard to poetry, and to love-scenes,
the taste of the age was wrong: yet he simply accorded
with that taste, and you cannot blame him for drifting with a race
that thought Johnson a poet! As for Fielding, though too diffuse
in style of remark, he is still immeasurably above Bulwer and his
countless spawn. And so is Richardson, maugre his epistolary prolixity;
and Goldsmith, with his quiet beauty and truth to nature,
transcends them all. But Bulwer, instead of the apotheosis his admirers
would bestow, deserves to do penance in purgatory for his
literary sins. As obscure as Coleridge, without his deep philosophy,
as glittering as Voltaire, without his sparkling wit, as seductive
as Byron, without his amazing strength, his wisdom is founded in a
few heartless maxims, and his poetry is comprized in a Rhyming
Dictionary.”</p>

<p><i>Tristo.</i> “No! Pulito, you are wrong there. I have heard your
discussion with interest, and allow me to draw the line, which, in
cooler moments, you would both approve. Bulwer is a scholar, and
a genius, and essentially a poet. That he is a scholar, and a ripe
one, no one that has read his Ambitious Student, and, above all, his
Last Days of Pompeii, can doubt for an instant. When I look at
the fact that he has founded a new school in romance; that he has
written eight or ten novels, all different, all original, all <i>creative</i> in
their kind; that we follow his characters from their entrance to their
exit, with feverish and untiring interest; that in his own path no one
approaches him, and that for eight years he has supported his reputation,
I see not how he can be denied many of the attributes of
genius. And that he is, <i>in heart</i>, a poet, despite his Siamese
Twins, is equally evident to me. He is certainly fertile in invention,
rich in expression, and powerful in pathos. I know not where
to find any thing more poetic, more moving, than the character of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Lucy Brandon, and her twilight interview with Clifford at the lattice,
the beautifully simple portraiture of Mydia, and, above all, the
crossed love, and shattered hopes of the Ambitious Student. I say
that he <i>does</i> possess wit and humor, and poetry, and talent, and that
in large abundance. Yet his power is more in the <i>manner</i> than the
<i>matter</i>; for he is often superficial, and his pictures of the world,
though faithful and clear in parts, are false and confused as a whole.
Their coloring is too high. He strains for effect. His views in
politics, in ethics, and religion, are all shifting. If a brilliant thought
occurs, he pauses little upon its truth or consistency with his previous
sentiments. Because red and blue are <i>both</i> beautiful, he lays
them on together. You view his pictures as in a glass, and depart,
‘straitway forgetting what manner of man he is.’ He makes all his
heroes think and act splendidly for the moment; but their thoughts
and actions are incongruous as a whole&mdash;they war among themselves.
A man cannot at once be patient and resentful, thoughtful and careless,
or learned and an idler. Again&mdash;his style is as bad as it is
brilliant&mdash;it is affected&mdash;sometimes tawdry. His novels are bad,
<i>very</i> bad, in their tendency. He marries vice and virtue; he joins
nobleness to sin; he makes man the puppet of fate or circumstance;
around the desperate offender he weaves a spell of enchantment; we
follow his heroes with wonder and pity and love, through all their
paths of crime and glory, and we close the book with a sigh that ourselves
were not born with natures so high, and destinies so splendid,
even at the price of all their wretchedness, and all their guilt. Bulwer
may talk, and talk of virtue and religion, till his hair is gray&mdash;but
his principles are poison. And if he be dangerous, his imitators are
contemptible. Without a tithe of his power, they are more corrupt.
Their works are prolific as the rod of Aaron, and lean as the kine of
Pharaoh. In regard to talent, making allowance for the greater
freshness of his novels, and that sympathy which we feel for every
thing of our own day, and remembering that he had all <i>their</i> excellencies
to build upon, and imitate, I should place him far below both
Fielding and Smollett in mental power. Those older writers,
though freer in language, are far less corrupt and enervate in thought,
than these modern profligates. In <i>those</i>, there is a style simple, vigorous,
and clear, and reflection solid, rational, and just&mdash;in <i>these</i>
there is a continual reaching forth after singularity and power. <i>Those</i>
draw faithful figures, though larger, perhaps, than life&mdash;but <i>these</i>
present distortions&mdash;wicked daubs&mdash;gross flatteries, or else vile libels
upon human nature. <i>There</i> is thought&mdash;<i>here</i>, sentiment&mdash;<i>there</i>,
rough gold&mdash;<i>here</i>, spangled tinsel. <i>Those</i> are chalybeate streams,
which come tumbling from mountains of iron, with waves dark, but
salubrious: while <i>these</i> are rivulets from mercurial mines, that dance
swiftly along their shining bed, with waters bright, but destructive.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_INFLUENCE_OF_MORAL_FEELING_ON_THE_PLEASURES_OF">THE INFLUENCE OF MORAL FEELING ON THE PLEASURES OF
THE IMAGINATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">No. II.</p>

<p>The influence of moral feeling tends to heighten the pleasure
which we derive from the contemplation of great actions.</p>

<p>Turn over the pages of history and philosophy&mdash;study the record
of human events, and the laws of the mind, and we gather as their
united testimony, the truth, that in all ages of the world, whatever
has carried with it the impress of intellect, has commanded the
homage of men. Even among rude and barbarous nations, he who
distinguishes himself by some act of superior sagacity or valor, gains
the ascendancy over his rivals, and is worshiped as Chief. The
meed of honor in this case, is the result of a blind, but still a controlling
admiration for the effect, unattended by a recognition of
the cause. In more civilized communities, it is an enlightened and
intelligent tribute to the offspring of mind.</p>

<p>To the man of imagination there is a powerful charm in the spectacle
of a great mind throwing off the grave clothes of inactivity,
and arousing itself for some mighty effort. There is almost a fearful
grandeur in its movements, as it calls up one after another its
slumbering energies, and girds itself for the struggle. And when it
goes forth in its power to achieve the purposes which it has formed,
it treads with a sternness and majesty which fling around it an irresistible
spell. It is not simply the exhibition of vast strength which
it presents, like the exertion of mere brute force, or the plunge of a
falling avalanche, that awakens in the beholder these emotions of
interest and delight. There is, it is true, in all such exhibitions,
much to inspire sublimity of feeling. But the appeal which we
speak of now, owes its effect to other associations of thought. It is
the soul, the living, moving principle within, directing and controlling
the whole, bending the will and purposes of others into subservience
to its own ‘ruling passion,’ like the earth born giant of old,
rising with fresh strength from every grapple with opposition, and
pressing right onward to the goal of its wishes, with a progress that
resembles the sure march of destiny&mdash;it is this which gives to the
sublimity of intellect its distinguishing characteristics. With such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
mind, the man of imagination cherishes a fellow feeling, entering
into its aspirations with kindred ardor, watching with intense interest
its struggles against difficulties, sharing its gloom in the hour of
trial, and its exultation at success. This thrill of sympathy is with
him the vibration of the chord which binds him to the universe, and
to his fellow man. Shut him out from such a kindred with his race;
seal up the fountain of ever-flowing sensibility within his bosom, bid
him gaze upon the sublime achievements of intellect, with a stoic’s
indifference, and you have cut off from him a source of happiness
of the purest and most exalted character, and left him a blank on
creation’s page.</p>

<p>In our contemplation of great actions, perhaps no exercise affords
the imagination more pleasure, than to observe the progress of some
mighty revolution. At first, all is apparently calm and peaceful on
the surface of society, and the beholder finds nothing in the cloudless
sky above, the whispering breeze, or the unruffled serenity beneath,
to forebode the fury of the coming tempest. He does not
dream that the waves of discord and strife are so soon to dash their
foam along the mirror-like tranquillity before him. Yet the principles
may be already at work, whose influence is to arouse these slumbering
elements to a fearful energy. Some youthful mind, destined to
be the master spirit of its age, may be, even at the moment, preparing
within the still retreat of its lonely musings, by patient and toilsome
research, the great problem whose solution is to shake the existing
system of things to its foundations. At length the fullness of
the time is come, and “the little cloud like a man’s hand,” rears its
shadowy outline far in the distant horizon. The voice of the tempest
is heard moaning in suppressed accents, as though wailing a
dirge over the wreck it must make. Darker and still darker above,
the sky spreads out its drapery of mantling clouds. The spirits of
the storm awake, and ride forth on the howling blast, amid the wild
roar of the elements, celebrating the festival of their freedom. The
tempest at length has spent its rage, the pall of blackness is withdrawn,
and the bow of promise gives goodly token of the returning
calm. This may seem perhaps a fanciful description of a revolution.
But to the cultivated imagination, the reality calls up all the intenseness
of interest and excitement which belong to scenes like these.
The storm of human passions, when stirred up and left to range uncontrolled
through a community, gathering in its ranks the ruthless
votaries of ambition, avarice and revenge, urged, as it sweeps onward,
by a thousand new impulses from selfish and opposing interests,
may well be likened to the strife of the angry elements. There is
in the majestic energies of human nature, when aroused and carried
forward with a momentum generated by the heart, an exhibition of
more terrific sublimity than all the varied convulsions in the physical
world can possibly present. But we have said enough on this
point, to show, that the source of pleasure to the imagination, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
we are at present considering, is one of no ordinary character, both
in respect to the nature and degree of the gratification which it induces.
And it is now high time that we return to our main object,
which is to notice the influence of moral feeling in enhancing our
susceptibility to this kind of intellectual enjoyment.</p>

<p>We look back with admiration upon the exploits of an Alexander;
we are struck by the power of his genius, by the grandeur of his
designs, the perseverance and energy of his execution. But the
truth&mdash;the sober truth, with its disenchanting wand, breaks the
charm which these throw around his memory, and compel our minds,
divested of all enthusiasm, to sink their admiration of the hero in
their aversion to the unprincipled robber of nations. But on the
other hand, with how much of unmingled delight does the imagination
contemplate the high moral dignity so conspicuous in the character
of Washington. Both are splendid instances of the triumphs
of genius; but with what different sentiments are they regarded!
Over the memory of the latter, the purity of his motives and the
disinterestedness of his ambition, have thrown a hallowed and unclouded
atmosphere. Thus, it is only when great talents are ennobled
by their subservience to virtue, that they receive the meed of
unqualified admiration. As another illustration of this truth, notice
the reformation in Germany&mdash;one of the most eventful dramas ever
acted upon the theatre of the world. Perhaps there is no succession
of events recorded on the page of history, which inspires the
imagination with more thrilling interest&mdash;no prouder monument of
the achievements of a single mind.</p>

<p>For a period of not less than a thousand years, the darkness of midnight
had brooded over the nations of the east, relieved occasionally
by some meteor star, whose solitary and transient gleam seemed
only to deepen by contrast the surrounding gloom that succeeded.
The curse of Papacy, with its ignorance, depravity, and superstition,
lay like the frosts of winter upon the intellect and the heart of
man; and the progress of true principles seemed to have been arrested
forever. At this period of mental and moral gloom, nearly
coeval with the dawn of reviving knowledge, arose the man who
was to usher in the commencement of a new and glorious era. He
had stood amid the worship of the temple at Rome, and been an
eye witness to the luxury and licentiousness that defiled the consecrated
courts. The name of the Holy City&mdash;the residence of the
Vicar of Christ, had been treasured up in his mind from boyhood,
with sacred associations. Alas, how changed from the image that
his fond anticipations had pictured out! That moment gave birth in
his soul to a mighty thought. He stood undazzled and unallured,
though Rome’s pomp, and gaiety and beauty were spread out like a
sea of enchantment before him. From that hour, Martin Luther
was a champion of the truth&mdash;of the simple, unperverted truth.
Year after year, with an ardor unchecked by difficulties, undaunted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
by the threats of power, he continued to pour the light of his own
illumination over the nations of Europe, until the temple of Papacy
shook to its foundations, and every Catholic king trembled on his
throne. In contemplating this wonderful revolution, it is difficult to
decide, whether our admiration should be most excited by the magnitude
of the event, or the apparent total inadequacy of the means.
A humble and unknown individual, with the Bible in his hand as his
only weapon of warfare, enters the field against a Pontifical hierarchy,
that had swayed for ages the sceptre of an absolute dominion&mdash;and
<span class="allsmcap">PREVAILS</span>. The sublimity and grandeur of the achievement
itself would be deservedly a theme for the highest flight of the poet’s
muse, and the most glowing strains of the historian. But it is only
when we consider the nature of this triumph, that its full power, as a
source of pleasure to the imagination, can be appreciated. It was
a triumph of knowledge over ignorance. The light of science, which
had so long glimmered but faintly, and at intervals, from the cell of
the cloister, now burst forth in full orbed glory&mdash;‘rejoicing like a giant
to run his race.’ It was a triumph of literature and refinement over
brutality and barbarism. From the frozen waters of the north, to
the pillars of Hercules, the intellect of Europe shook off the weight
of its darkness, and awoke to life and activity. It was a triumph of
the pure simplicity of the Christian faith over idolatry, hypocrisy
and superstition. The degraded slave of popish tyranny and imposition
cast away the shackles of his bondage, and arose to assert
the dignity of his nature. On every thing that had been enveloped
in the universal chaos, the almighty mandate was written, “Let
there be light.” Thus, in contemplating this great revolution, it is
in the power of its appeal to our moral sensibilities, that its true sublimity
is seen and felt.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_OUTLAW_AND_HIS_DAUGHTER">THE OUTLAW AND HIS DAUGHTER.</h2>
</div>

<p>At the termination of one of those revolutions which have convulsed
the Mexican States from their earliest formation, Herraras,
who had been an active partizan, finding his own side in the minority,
sought in retirement a refuge from the turmoils of political life,
and protection for the innocence, with facilities for the education of
his motherless daughter. This he realized, until it began to be rumored,
and not without foundation, that he was secretly leagued
with the piratical smugglers. He who intended to reap the chief
advantage from a public prosecution, was young Velasque, a favorite
of the Administration, whose sole motive was a vehement passion
for the daughter of Herraras, which as yet the jealous fondness of
the father for his own child, and the aversion of the adolescent Almirena
herself, had with vexatious firmness resisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>‘Surrender your daughter to my solicitations, and my influence
with the Government shall secure your acquittal; otherwise, you
must die, and&mdash;<i>I will be avenged</i>’&mdash;sternly uttered the wily amorado.</p>

<p>‘Leave me till morning, and you shall have my answer,’ replied
the perplexed and indignant father.</p>

<p>That morning discovered him with his child many leagues from the
Mexican coast, in a vessel bound to the United States, whose sudden
departure he had procured by bribes, after having, under cover
of the night, with the aid of a faithful servant, taken on board of it,
a rich amount of his ill-gotten treasure.</p>

<p>On the borders of one of those lakes whose silvery surfaces may
be frequently seen imbosomed among the wild highlands of New
England, near the margin of a forest that encircled its waters with a
drapery of dark green foliage, and luxuriant vines, and stretched far
away over the circumjacent mountains, the outlaw had chosen his
retreat. A few roods of ground were cleared around his lodge, which
was secured from view in the direction of the lake, by a narrow file
of trees and underwood, and on all other sides, by the unbroken forest.
Here the refugee lived, sequestered from the world, his only
companion his child; with a single attendant, an African, the menial
of the lodge, and only visiter of the village that lay over the mountains,
and was the nearest within many miles of circuit, where the
servant went for the supplies of the family. The outlaw suffered
no stranger to enter his precincts, partly because he feared lest
justice should find an avenue to his guilt, and partly because he
dreaded an interruption to the communion of affection between him
and his daughter. He loved his child as few fathers love their offspring.
He had always cherished her as the “apple of his eye.”
But since his recent misfortunes, all other feelings had become extinct,
or submerged in this one passion. He loved her because she
was the image of her mother, who had been the young idol of his
soul. He loved her because she was a part of himself, and his own
dark eye flashed beneath her brow. She was all the world had left
him which he could call his own. To make her father happy, and
witness his cloudy features clear away in smiles, was the dearest delight
of the affectionate daughter. He could not bear her a moment
from his presence, which she, at the least sound of danger as instinctively
sought, as the timid lamb bounds away to its dam.
Music was to both father and child an exhilaration of pleasure, and
relieved of its weariness many a lonely hour. He had instructed
her to play the guitar, whose strings responding to the skilful touch
of her fingers, trilled in his ear the sweet airs of his youth; while
her zephyr-like voice poured forth, in rich harmony with his deep bass,
those lays that awakened fostered memories in his bosom. She read
to him from his favorite Spanish authors, a few of which he had
brought to be companions of his exile. A daily and indulged employment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
for the Mexican was sailing upon the lake, and angling
for fish that were numerous in its waters. He had constructed for
his daughter a light canoe with which she accompanied her father.
While he fished, she sported with her little bark, which she learned
to scull with such art, that like the shell of the Nautilus, it seemed
of itself to glide through the waters. When the wind was high, so
lightly and fearless did she skim over the curling tops of the waves,
and so shrill and clear she sounded her notes on the air, that her father
called her his Bird of the Lake. When the summer’s sun was shining
hot, she would oar her boat along the shore, under the archway
of the trees; here she twanged her guitar, or decked her hair
with flowers from the banks, or filled her basket from the grape vines
that twined among the low hanging limbs.</p>

<p>One day she sailed farther up the shore, and had unconsciously
steered her boat into a sheltered cove. She was seated platting a
chaplet of leaves; and as she adjusted it to her head, she looked
into the water, so darkly shaded by the surrounding trees that it
reflected her image clear as a mirror, and bright as her beautiful self.
Not like Narcissus was she in love with her own image; but her father
had told her that her hair and forehead were like her mother’s&mdash;that
mother whom she had never seen&mdash;that she wore wreaths in
her hair; and the fond orphan smiled at the resemblance, and seemed,
as she gazed, to be enamored of the beauty whose early blight
her father so bitterly mourned.</p>

<p>But the real beauty of this illusion was not without its charms.
A young man, in the guise of a sportsman, attracted by the murmuring
echoes of the music this Nereid warbled, had silently approached
the waters, and screened behind a tuft of laurel shrubbery
was looking, in breathless wonder, and deeply fascinated, upon this
seemingly unearthly visitant of his mountain lake.</p>

<p>That a gloomy browed foreigner with his child, had come to reside
near the lake was known in the village. Many suspicions
were afloat as to his character. Few had seen the renegade. Even
young Clermont, whose hunting excursions were fearlessly and widely
extended, had not ventured near the dwelling of the recluse;
nor had he dreamed what a flower was blooming in the dark woods
of his native hills.</p>

<p>Almirena raised herself in her boat and attempted to pluck a rose
that grew wild from a projecting rock. A tropical sun had imbrowned
her skin; but polished the jet of her eyes to a higher brilliance; and
her raven tresses floated more luxuriantly over her unbared neck.
Attired in the costume of her country, her light vest open in front,
with its flowing collar, and gathered loosely about her waist, revealed
a form of classic mould; while her silken skirt, with its rich embroidery,
excited still more the surprise of Clermont, who had seen
in that retired district, only the simple dresses of rural life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>Perceiving that she could not easily reach the flower, Clermont,
who had been fixed in his concealment by the enchantment of the
vision, advanced to her view and offered his assistance. She was
startled at the sudden apparition, and seized her oar. She did not
know his language, but his gentle tones and supplicating gestures,
tempted her to come nearer the bank and take the rose he offered,
and then like the timid bird that picks one kernel from your hand,
not staying for more flowers, which he would have gathered, she
flew away over the waters.</p>

<p>Elfred Clermont, the son of the wealthy merchant of the village
to which we have before alluded, was advanced in his professional
studies, and at the time we are narrating, passing a vacation at home.
With romance and enthusiasm commixed in his nature, refined in his
feelings, he met with little congeniality of spirit among the rustic
yeomanry of his native town; while amid the rugged scenery of the
mountains, and deep gloom of the forests, he found his soul’s fondest
sympathy. Taking his gun, and sometimes a musical instrument,
he often pursued his solitary rambles; in the last of which he so unexpectedly
encountered the outlaw’s daughter.</p>

<p>That night the sleep of Almirena was feverish. Her dreams
were of the fair browed youth and his kind attentions. She awoke
wishing he were her brother. Aware of her father’s inveterate
aversion to any intercourse with the inhabitants of the vicinity, she
said nothing to him of her adventure. But the next day, while he
fished below, the hare-hearted girl, now emboldened by a feeling
which to her was new, and which she did not probably analyze, again
slowly propelled her canoe near the cove. The sound of music
struck her ear. She dropped her oar, and taking her guitar, touched
its chords. Its notes blended symphoniously in the sylvan recess
with the sweet sounds of the young stranger’s flute; while their
hearts were awakened to thrill in more exquisite melody. The ravished
Clermont ran down to the water’s edge, and with a rich bouquet
of flowers, which he held up to her view, prevailed upon her to
approach the shore. He kissed the deep blushes from her cheek, as
he assisted her to debark; and the stranger lovers sat down together
upon the moss covered bank.</p>

<p>They did not understand each other’s language. But Nature has
a dialect which she teaches all her children. The heart finds utterance
not in artificial characters, but in burning expression. Music
too speaks in glowing tones to the very ear of feeling.</p>

<p>They often met; he of the blue eyed Saxon race, she of the
darker Roman origin&mdash;both impassioned; he from the gushing enthusiasm
of his being, she from the ardent temperament of her
southern skies. His love was pure as if she had been his sister.
Hers as confiding as if he were her brother. Elfred soon acquired
her native tongue, and instructed a ready learner in his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Herraras had marked the change in his daughter, and forbade her
interviews with the young American. She implored; but he was
inflexible. He loved his child, but with a love that could not be
severed from its object. ‘What music is that?’ as a familiar air
came quivering through the latticed window of his cottage, inquired
the outlaw, with an emotion that was never kindled except at the
voice of his child, or the sound of her guitar. ‘Has a minstrel of
our own country wandered hither?’</p>

<p>‘Shall I call the player, father?’ eagerly asked the child.</p>

<p>‘I would see him.’</p>

<p>She ran for her lover.&mdash;Her artifice succeeded. Elfred was admitted
to the lodge. The music of his flute, his frequent conversations
with the Mexican in his own language, tended somewhat to
revive humanity in the seared breast of the outlaw. But the doting
father could not be induced to yield up his daughter to the solicitations
of Clermont, who was at length obliged, quite in despair, to
cease pressing his suit with the old man, though he still visited at
the lodge. Almirena’s filial piety was too closely interwoven with
her father’s happiness to allow her to thwart his wishes, yet at the
same time she twined about Elfred in all the artlessness and strength
of her love.</p>

<p>The exiles were seated one afternoon in the front apartment of
the cottage, when the door was darkened by a strange form. The
features of Velasque broke upon them like a fiend’s, hellish with revenge,
blood-shot with lust. The outlaw stirred not, only hoarsely
uttered ‘devil!’</p>

<p>‘I have come for my revenge,’ alternated the intruder, in a tone
of cool, malignant triumph.</p>

<p>Almirena shrieked out as the tiger-like eyes of Velasque gleamed
upon her.</p>

<p>The young Mexican immediately assumed a more familiar manner,
and declared to the imperturbed outlaw, that he had been convicted
of piracy in his own country, and that himself was accompanied
by a party of United States officers, who were furnished with a
warrant for his arrest from their Government. While they delayed
in the woods, he had advanced professedly to reconnoitre, but really
to parley.</p>

<p>‘You may escape if’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘If!’ thundered out the infuriated father. He checked his
words. For a moment the storm of feeling raged within his breast.
‘I die,’ at length he said. ‘But we will pray before we go. Yonder
is the image of our Mother.’ He led his daughter into a back
room. ‘Now pray for protection.’ He whispered in agony, ‘fly&mdash;fly
to your boat&mdash;you will be safe. I suffer for my guilt.’ The
terrified child, the affectionate daughter, would have stayed by her
father. But he sternly urged her forward. She sped her way
to the lake. Velasque, suspecting an artifice, advanced; and missing
his victim, dashed impetuously by Herraras, hurling the old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
man to the floor as he impotently endeavored to oppose him, and
ran down the wood-skirted path to the waters. The resolute girl
had pushed her canoe from the shore, and standing erect was vigorously
plying her oar. Her pursuer seized her father’s boat; but the
wind was up, and the waves mocked his strong-nerved efforts. She
seemingly leaped from crest to crest. He called after her. The
wind returned upon him his voice; and her flowing locks streamed
in wilder witchery to his view. Nearing the shore, she sprang from
her boat, and bounded away like a young fawn through the forest,
leaving her vexed pursuer far behind.</p>

<p>The outlaw, recovering from his violent fall, hurried for the water.
Velasque was far on the lake. The old man hastened along the
shore to meet his daughter on the upper extremity of the lake.
He found her in a branch-vaulted glen, concealed under an arbor
that Clermont had constructed for their stolen interviews; scarcely
did he begin to tranquillize his child, now fluttering with fear, and
exhausted by her efforts, when Velasque leaped down the side of
the glen. They stood face to face&mdash;the outlaw and the exasperated
lover. ‘Obstinate old man,’ said the latter, ‘thou shalt die, and thy
defenseless daughter shall be subdued to my wishes, if thou wilt
not now acknowledge her mine.’ The old man replied not. Almirena,
deadly pale, staggered forward to her father, and extending
up to him her clasped hands, groaned out, ‘Oh my father, let me
be honorably his.’ Nature failed her&mdash;she fell lifeless at his feet.
Velasque stooped forward to raise her. But the maddened old man,
with unnatural nerve, ran upon him, and precipitated him down a
chasm in the rocks. The officers, who had been on the alert in the
woods, now came up.</p>

<p>They bore the unconscious form of Almirena to the lodge, and
consigned it to the care of her tender hearted slave. The wounded
Velasque was carried away on a litter. The outlaw was manacled.
He was supposed to be a bloody-handed, ferocious pirate. And as
the girl was thought to be an accomplice in her father’s guilt, the
officers had little pity for either. They did not permit the old man
to go to his house and take a last look of his child; but conveying
him by a nearer way through the valley of the lake, on the next
morning they reached the sea-port, and lodged the outlaw in prison,
where he was to be confined until Velasque should be sufficiently
recovered to take charge of him to Mexico. Herraras was not sorry
that his daughter had died. He knew that his own fate was sealed,
and that she should live, exposed to the violence of Velasque, would
have been worse than death on the rack to himself. He settled
down in a calm, sullen submission to his destiny.</p>

<p>But Almirena lived. She had fainted; but awoke in a delirium.
Clermont did not come to the lodge till the following morning. She
wildly addressed him as he entered, ‘Farewell, Elfred, farewell. I
have given myself to Velasque, and he spares my father’s life. You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
would see me before I go. Farewell. One kiss, one more;’ and
she threw her arms about his neck, as he leaned over her, and sobbed
like a child. For weeks did her lover watch in patient agony
by her side. At length she slowly recovered.</p>

<p>Velasque did die. Foiled in his chief design, his spirits sunk, and
he had not sufficient energy to counteract the effects of his wounds,
which soon terminated his existence. Velasque being the only witness
against the outlaw, and no one appearing to prosecute the case
farther, he might have been discharged; but a new suit was instituted
by those who had accompanied Velasque, charging him with the
murder of the Mexican. He possessed no evidence to countervail
the accusation. A stranger in a strange land, a condemned pirate immured
in a prison, he had not heard that his daughter was yet alive.
The popular feeling was against him. Clermont, who, being busy
and remote, and also too fearful of the guilt of Herraras in respect
to piracy, had not interested himself to learn what was transpiring,
did not arrive at the court, till the evidence on the part of
the state had been received. He was admitted to manage the defense.
He called only one witness, the lovely daughter of the prisoner.
As the hard-visaged outlaw met his child, the living from
the dead, and held her in his embrace, his iron soul seemed to melt,
and flow out at his eyes; a sight that turned the sympathies of the
spectators in his favor. Almirena’s story was simple, and touching,
in manifestation of the villainy of Velasque. Clermont conducted
the case, to him, and all, now most intensely interesting, by an ingenious
and manly argument in point of the prisoner’s having acted
in defense of himself, and of the honor of his daughter. The outlaw
was acquitted.</p>

<p>Herraras cheerfully yielded his daughter to his noble deliverer, her
devoted lover; stipulating only that he might love her yet, for the
sake of her mother. In tranquillity, and penitence for early misdeeds,
the outlaw passed his days. Clermont, under another name,
has arisen to distinction; but yearly does he revisit with his still
beautiful Mexican wife, the lake of their romantic loves.</p>

<p>“Cows, of all animals, have the greatest propensity for rumination. For the
most part, they are gentle, quiet, affectionate, unpretending, useful animals; all
they require is kindness, and kindness they will return. Yet they have their antipathies
and their whims, (red shawls are their abomination,) but, on the whole,
they are inoffensive ruminators&mdash;not obtrusive, (except when they take a fancy to
<i>gore</i>.) Their caresses are rough as their tongues; yet their roughest <i>licks</i> are
meant in kindness. They never bite&mdash;their teeth are ground down. They are
neither snappish nor carnivorous. They are remarkably fond of salt, and are
quick to detect its presence. Although timid and yielding in general, they will
fight any one, or any thing, in defense of their young.”</p>

<p>The last quoted author has described with remarkable correctness,
in his remarks upon the cow, the character of a being, of
whose existence he could not have dreamed&mdash;even of myself. Yes,
even such I conceive to be my character&mdash;the coat fits, and I will
put it on&mdash;“under such a shape I write.” Being in external appearance,
a hale, stout, fat old bachelor of fifty, fond of the arm-chair and
the comfortable dressing-gown, of easy fortune, retired habits, and
few friends, I am, in soul, thought and disposition, and to all intents
and purposes, <i>a gentle old cow</i>. Nor is there any thing humiliating
in the confession. I esteem the character&mdash;I admire it. Would to
heaven that in these <i>matter-of-fact, dollar-and-cent</i> days, there
were more men of my nature! I injure no man; but if any man
injures me, I have horns and can gore him, a tail and can lash him.
In consideration of the unsullied purity of my character in my manly
state, I have ventured to conceive that I am, in the bovine genus,
that most amiable non-descript, an old maid. Still, I am no Io&mdash;nor
Io turned old maid. I never was handsome enough to warm
the soul of Jove, nor mad enough to swim the Bosphorus. I am
not, never was, and never will be, Oestrus-driven. The many-eyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
shepherd, Argus, if ordered to watch <i>me</i>, would have needed only
one of his hundred eyes&mdash;he might have seen me, even with “half
an eye,” quietly grazing, all the morning of my life, in the flowery
meads of Literature, Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics&mdash;ever and
anon, quenching my thirst with a draft from the pure stream of Helicon&mdash;and
now, in the afternoon of life, reclined upon the grass, under
the shade of a branching, verdant oak, placidly, philosophically,
philanthropically, and withal meekly chewing the stock which I formerly
stored.</p>

<h3>RUMINATION FIRST.</h3>

<p>I was recalling to memory, the other day, all the friends and acquaintance
of my boyhood and youth, that I could recollect; and I
mustered a goodly list. My mind wandered from their <i>names</i> to
their hopes and plans; I recalled the schemes and enterprizes, which
I knew they had meditated. The train once started, visions of bygone
days and circumstances poured in upon me. Again, I sauntered,
arm in arm, with a friend, through the moon-lit streets, on a
summer’s evening&mdash;again, I wandered listlessly along the beach&mdash;again,
I stood upon the summits of the hills which surrounded the
abode of my youth&mdash;again, I heard the confiding strain of youthful
friendship&mdash;I saw the face lit with the joy of anticipated triumph&mdash;the
step, unnaturally firm, proud and elastic. Alas! where now
were those friends? Some were dead&mdash;some were in obscurity&mdash;many
were in mediocrity of life&mdash;few, how few, had <i>approached</i> the
goal of their youthful wishes. And what was the cause of all this?
Was the fault in the men, or their plans? Upon the <i>plans</i> I fixed
it; for I could not, and I would not, lay aught to the charge of the
loved ones of my youth. And where was the fault in the plans?
Was it not <i>here</i>&mdash;that the <i>plans</i> were founded on the <i>hopes</i>, while
the <i>hopes</i> should have been founded on the <i>plans</i>? <i>Hope</i> is the
<i>etherial</i>&mdash;<i>plan</i> the <i>material</i> part of an expectation. A plan, founded
on a hope, is like a house founded on the sand&mdash;it cannot endure.
As verdant forests and luxuriant vegetation adorn and beautify the
sides, and white fleecy clouds cap the summits, of a rock-based
mountain, softening the rugged cliffs, filling up the chasms, smoothing
the precipices, and concealing the roughness of the path which
winds up the ascent; so should <i>Hope</i>, with its varied hues, tinge
and adorn the ever-during frame-work reared by <i>Reason</i>. So <i>should</i>
it be&mdash;but, is it so? Do not men strive rather to throw a semblance
of reason over their hopes? Do they not build castles in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
air, and then exert all their ingenuity to give an appearance of probability,
or at least of <i>possibility</i>, to their baseless fabrics?</p>

<p>O Hope! thou art a blessing, and thou art a <i>curse</i>. Thou art an
intrusive, impudent, officious, treacherous <i>imp</i>&mdash;thou art a lying
varlet&mdash;a cheating knave&mdash;thou hast no conscience&mdash;thou wilt gull,
over and over again, prince and peasant, rich and poor, the unjust
judge and the oppressed widow. Men kick thee out of doors, and
again thou comest. Thou art a very Proteus&mdash;deny thee entrance
in <i>one</i> shape, and instantly thou takest another. Sometimes thou
servest the devil, and sometimes thou doest business on thine own
account. Again, I say, hang thee for an intermeddling imp!</p>

<p>Men talk of the pleasures of hope! have they never felt the misery
of hope deferred&mdash;the pang of hope crushed? Have they ever
estimated the amount of misery chargeable to this self-same hope?
Who fathers Ambition, with all its woes, attendant and consequent?
Hope. How many dream away their lives in listless vacuity, <i>hoping</i>
all the while, that <i>something will turn up</i>! What injuries has
Hope not done to youth? Then, when men ought to be training
themselves for the stern realities of life&mdash;when they should prepare
their provisions for its stormy voyage, Hope whispers that the course
is clear&mdash;the ocean calm&mdash;the wind favorable. How many commence
enterprizes, which can end in nothing but disappointment,
and undertake duties, to the performance of which their abilities are
inadequate, spirited on the while by Hope, the traitor, who stimulates
his unconscious victims to mount round after round of the ladder,
until, with a whoop and a laugh, he tears the veil from their
eyes, and permits them to see and to <i>feel</i> that they are high, not on
the temple, but on the <i>pillory</i> of Fame! ‘Hope sweetens labor’&mdash;does
he? ‘Thank you, madam, I prefer it without sugar.’</p>

<p>Hold! I revoke&mdash;I take back somewhat that I have said. Hope&mdash;thou
art an imp, but still a <i>playful</i> imp&mdash;full of mischief, but such
a lively, laughing, little, curly-headed rogue, with such a comical
look in the corner of thine eye, that for my life I cannot lose thee.
I am inclined to say to thee, as one said to his dog&mdash;‘Ah! Tray!
thou little knowest the mischief thou hast done.’</p>

<p>Here follow a few melancholy breathings of that better part, which
shone bright and burning while it lasted, though its food was error,
and its end was death. Their aspirations after immortality were
few and faint&mdash;for the very existence of another world was merely
an assumption&mdash;a matter of speculation. An immortality of fame, to
the sober eye, was not merely worthless, if acquired, but its acquisition
was a thing of toil, and danger, and doubt. Robbed of the
high aims and hopes for which it was made, “the chainless spirit of
the eternal mind,” would stoop to no medium flight, but sunk in
hopeless despondence, and like guilty Adam,</p>

<p>“The Character of the Indian,” though inadmissible, is not without
merit. In manner it is nearly faultless; in matter, too commonplace
to be either instructive or entertaining.</p>

<p>“F.” had better send his verses to “R.” in manuscript. She
would undoubtedly greet them with a hearty welcome.</p>

<p>“P.’s” poetry on Poland, though apparently somewhat in years,
is filed for insertion. The prolegomena, on account of their too
great length, are declined.</p>

<p>“Loose Thoughts on Smoking”&mdash;much too loose for publication.
We find no fault with the author’s habit, but think he had better

<p>An <i>apology</i> for establishing a Literary Magazine, in an institution
like Yale College, can hardly be deemed requisite by an enlightened
public; yet a statement of the objects which are proposed
in this Periodical, may not be out of place.</p>

<p>To foster a literary spirit, and to furnish a medium for its exercise;
to rescue from utter waste the many thoughts and musings of
a student’s leisure hours; and to afford some opportunity to train
ourselves for the strife and collision of mind which we must expect
in after life;&mdash;such, and similar motives have urged us to this undertaking.</p>

<p>So long as we confine ourselves to these simple objects, and do
not forget the modesty becoming our years and station, we confidently
hope for the approbation and support of all who wish well
to this institution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The work will be printed on fine paper and good type. Three
numbers to be issued every term, each containing about 40 pages,

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
